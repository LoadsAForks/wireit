      # The goal here is to always run the full caching test suite against the
      # live GitHub Actions Cache service, even if none of our code has changed,
      # in case something changed on the backend.
      #
      # So, slightly confusingly, although we disable caching of the top-level
      # test script below, we do need the runner environment set up to allow
      # GitHub caching.
